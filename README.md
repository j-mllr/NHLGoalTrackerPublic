# NHLGoalTracker

NHL android application that allows user to select a team and retrieve the live score of the game (if team is currently playing). If team is not scheduled, it will say "No Games Today". If game has not yet commenced, it give the time that the game starts in the timezone of the hometeam. 

# Improvements to be made:
Improve UI - not the prettiest at the moment <br />
Refactor code to make it more clean and easier to follow <br />
Eventually add in push notification if user's selected team scores a goal <br />
